# Qubes Split SSH

Split SSH implements a concept similar to having a smart card with your private SSH keys, except that the role of the “smart card” is played by another Qubes AppVM. 
This Qubes setup allows you to keep your SSH private keys in a vault VM (`vault`) while using an SSH Client VM (`ssh-client`) to access your remote server. 
This is done by using Qubes's [qrexec][qrexec] framework to connect a local SSH Agent socket from your SSH Client VM to the SSH Agent socket within the vault VM. 
This way the compromise of the domain you use to connect to your remote server does not allow the attacker to automatically also steal all your keys. 
(We should make a rather obvious comment here that the so-often-used passphrases on private keys are pretty meaningless because the attacker can easily set up a simple backdoor which would wait until the user enters the passphrase and steal the key then.)

## Overview

1. Make sure the TemplateVM you plan to use is up to date.
2. Create `vault` and `ssh-client` AppVMs.
3. Create an ssh key in your `vault` AppVM and set up automatic key adding prompt.
4. Set up VM interconnection
5. (Strongly Encouraged) Create a KeePassXC Database and set up SSH Agent Integration in KeePassXC.

## Preparing your system

- Make sure the templates you plan to base your AppVMs on are [up-to-date][update].

## [Creating AppVMs][appvm create]

If you’ve installed Qubes OS using the default options, a few qubes including a vault AppVM has been created for you. 
Skip the first step if you don't wish to create another vault.

1. Create a new vault AppVM (`vault`) based on your chosen template. Set networking to `(none)`.

   ![vault creation](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/80fad13c2d72b4f6ac4c03cd30d15ebd2c08a927.png)
   
2. Create a SSH Client AppVM (`ssh-client`). This VM will be used to make SSH connections to your remote machine.

   ![ssh-client creation](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/ff7c5d239b53906b8d1396381810b291d4364900.png)

## Setting up SSH

Perform the next steps in the AppVM `vault`.

1. Generate an SSH key pair. 
Skip this step if you already have your keys. 
Note that it is *okay* to not enter a password for your private keys since the `vault` AppVM has no networking.
If you still want to encrpt your keys refer to the section titled "Securing Your Private Key."

   ```shell_prompt
   [user@vault ~]$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 500
   Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519): 
   Created directory '/home/user/.ssh'.
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
   Enter same passphrase again: 
   Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519
   Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   The key fingerprint is:
   SHA256:DBxSxZcp16d1NSVSid3m8HRipUDM2INghQ4Sx3jPEDo user@vault
   The key's randomart image is:
   +--[ED25519 256]--+
   |    o==+++.@++o=*|
   |    o==o+ B BoOoB|
   |    Eoo* +   *.O.|
   |     . o+   .   o|
   |        S        |
   |                 |
   |                 |
   |                 |
   |                 |
   +----[SHA256]-----+
   ```
   **-t**: type<br/>
   **-a**: num_trials<br/>
    
   Please note that the key fingerprint and the randomart image will differ.
    
   For more information about `ssh-keygen`, run `man ssh-keygen`.
    
**Notice:** Skip the following steps if you plan on using KeePassXC.  

2. Make a new directory `~/.config/autostart`

   ```shell_prompt
   [user@fedora-32 ~]$ mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
   ```
      
3. Create the file `~/.config/autostart/ssh-add.desktop`

   - Open the file with e.g. `gedit`

        ```shell_prompt
        [user@fedora-32 ~]$ gedit ~/.config/autostart/ssh-add.desktop
        ```

   - Paste the following contents:

      ```shell_prompt
      [Desktop Entry]
      Name=ssh-add
      Exec=ssh-add
      Type=Application
      ```
        
   **Note:** If you've specified a custom name for your key using *-f*, you should adjust `Exec=ssh-add` to `Exec=ssh-add <path-to-your-key-file>`.

## Setting Up VM Interconnection

### In `dom0`:

1. Create and edit `/etc/qubes-rpc/qubes.SshAgent`.

   - Open the file with e.g. `nano`.

     ```shell_prompt
     [user@fedora-32 ~]$ sudo nano /etc/qubes-rpc/qubes.SshAgent
     ```

   - If you want to explicitly allow only this connection, add the following line:

      ```shell_prompt
      ssh-client vault ask
      ```

   - If you want to allow all VMs to connect, add the following line:

      ```shell_prompt
      @anyvm @anyvm ask
      ```

   - If you want the input field to be "prefilled" by your `vault` VM, append `default_target=vault` so it looks like for example:

      ```shell_prompt
      @anyvm @anyvm ask,default_target=vault
      ```
   
   **Note:** There are many ways to fine-tune this policy. For more details see the [Qubes qrexec documentation][PolicyFilesQubesOS]. 


### In the Template of Your AppVM `vault`:

1. Create and edit `/etc/qubes-rpc/qubes.SshAgent`.

   - Open the file with e.g. `gedit`

     ```shell_prompt
     [user@fedora-32 ~]$ sudo gedit /etc/qubes-rpc/qubes.SshAgent
     ```
     
   - Paste the following contents:
     
       ```shell_prompt
      #!/bin/sh
      # Qubes App Split SSH Script
     
      # safeguard - Qubes notification bubble for each ssh request
      notify-send "[`qubesdb-read /name`] SSH agent access from: $QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN"
     
      # SSH connection
      socat - UNIX-CONNECT:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK
      ```

### In the AppVM `ssh-client`

Theoretically, you can use any AppVM but to increase security it is advised to create a dedicated AppVM for your SSH connections.
Furthermore, you can set different firewall rules for each VM (i.e. for intranet and internet connections) which also provides additional protection.

1. Edit `/rw/config/rc.local`.

   - Open the file with e.g. `gedit`.

     ```shell_prompt
     [user@ssh-client ~]$ sudo gedit /rw/config/rc.local
     ```
   - Add the following to the bottom of the file:

      ```shell_prompt
      # SPLIT SSH CONFIGURATION >>>
      # replace "vault" with your AppVM name which stores the ssh private key(s)
      SSH_VAULT_VM="vault"

      if [ "$SSH_VAULT_VM" != "" ]; then
        export SSH_SOCK="/home/user/.SSH_AGENT_$SSH_VAULT_VM"
        rm -f "$SSH_SOCK"
        sudo -u user /bin/sh -c "umask 177 && exec socat 'UNIX-LISTEN:$SSH_SOCK,fork' 'EXEC:qrexec-client-vm $SSH_VAULT_VM qubes.SshAgent'" 
      fi
      # <<< SPLIT SSH CONFIGURATION
      ```

2. Edit `~/.bashrc` and add the following to the bottom of the file:

   - Open the file with e.g. `gedit`

     ```shell_prompt
     [user@ssh-client ~]$ gedit ~/.bashrc
     ```

   - Add the following to the bottom of the file:

      ```shell_prompt
      # SPLIT SSH CONFIGURATION >>>
      # replace "vault" with your AppVM name which stores the ssh private key(s)
      SSH_VAULT_VM="vault"
     
      if [ "$SSH_VAULT_VM" != "" ]; then
        export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/home/user/.SSH_AGENT_$SSH_VAULT_VM"
      fi
      # <<< SPLIT SSH CONFIGURATION
      ```

## Securing Your Private Key

Too tired to write this now lol.
Follow either one (but not both) of the configurations described below.

### Using the Built-in Password Utility and `ssh-askpass`

1. Add a password to your private key with `ssh-keygen -p`. 
Note that the location and name of your private key may differ.

   ```
   [user@vault ~]$ ssh-keygen -p 
   Enter file in which the key is (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519
   Key has comment 'user@vault'
   Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
   Enter same passphrase again: 
   Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase.
   ```
    
2. Install `ssh-askpass` in the template of your `vault` VM.

   For Fedora templates:<br/>
   ```
   [user@fedora-32 ~]$ sudo dnf install openssh-askpass
   ```

   For Debian templates:<br/>
   ```
   user@debian-10:~$ sudo apt-get install ssh-askpass
   ```
3. Shutdown the template and restart your `vault` VM.

With this configuration you'll be prompted for entering your password every time you start your vault VM to be able to make use of your SSH key. 

### Using [KeePassXC][KeePassXC]

**Warning:** This part is for setting up *KeePassXC*, not KeePassX or KeePass. See the [KeePassXC FAQ][KeePassXC FAQ].

KeePassXC should be installed by default in both Fedora and Debian TemplateVMs. If it’s not or you're using another template, you can [install it manually](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-domu/#installing-software-in-templatevms).

1. Add KeepasXC to the Applications menu of the newly created AppVM for ease of access and launch it.

   ![vault adding keepass](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/optimized/1X/e20e988e356ea63feda6760dca6a88fcd2a650c6_2_602x500.png)

   **Note:** Since the vault VM has no internet connection, you can safely deny automatic updates if prompted.

2. Create a new database.

   ![create database](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/a25e16fca7d5a394e9a9acdc017c9a02f7e6f4f4.png)

3. Enter a name for your database and continue.

   ![naming screen](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/0925cd8e469b6194f80b1e46e51d7f137a01dd74.png)

4. Adjust the encryption settings. 
Check the [KeePassXC User Guide][KeePassXC User Guide] for more information about these settings.

   ![encryption settings](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/optimized/1X/8537b07f453a0950d72cb51b9b5339e0f7bfc3c4_2_690x472.png)
   
5. Enter a password for your database. Take your time make a secure but also rememberable password. ([hint][Hint])

   ![password screen](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/413a9bbe68395ae07d1e2989735c9af53409071f.png)

6. Add a new entry.

   ![adding new entry](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/a5a6c74aac781f95db2909ce43058971e08e5407.png)
   
7. Set password to your SSH key passphrase.

   ![enter passphrase](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/881340d19c2e78e10374555a1a8867040b713cd2.png)
   
8. Go into the Advanced section and add your keys.

   ![adding keys](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/ff4a1197826ee69740251dbf8204d90b6cf4c6c8.png)

   **Note:** Technically, you only need to add the private key (id_25519) for the following steps to work. If you add the public key here, too, you can later on backup your kdbx file and have everything in one place. You can even delete your keys (`id_25519` and `id_25519.pub`) from your file system if you like.

9. Enable "SSH Agent Integration" within the Application Settings.

   ![enable ssh agent integration](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/optimized/1X/29dba9a7d44729cd8dce261cfecbbb63db3f4a70_2_594x500.png)
   
10. Restart KeePassXC

11. Check the SSH Agent Integration status.

    ![check integration status](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/2ef14b195947d2190306b500298379458d6194da.png)

12. Open the entry you created and select your private key in the "SSH Agent" section.

    ![select private key](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/optimized/1X/0d19ae6f3545a154823a8b3f8c89d52f6e0d6b68_2_594x500.png)

#### Testing the KeePassXC Setup

1. Close your KeePassXC database and run `ssh-add -L`. It should return `The agent has no identities.`

   ```shell_prompt
   [user@vault ~]$ ssh-add -L
   The agent has no identities.
   ```

2. Unlock your KeePassXC database and run `ssh-add -L` again. This time it should return your public key.

   ```shell_prompt
   [user@vault ~]$ ssh-add -L
   ssh-ed25519 <public key string> user@vault-keepassxc
   ```

## Test Your Configuration

1. If you're using KeePassXC, shutdown KeePassXC on your vault VM. 
If not, make sure your private key is not added to the ssh-agent in your vault VM (Check with `ssh-add -L`). 
If it is, restart your vault VM and do not enter your password when it asks you to.

2. Try fetching your identities on the SSH Client VM. 

   ```shell_prompt
   [user@ssh-client ~]$ ssh-add -L
   ```

3. Allow operation execution. (If you don't see the below prompt, check your VM interconnection setup.)

    ![operation execution](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/37e62ebb62482d83d878e3481161c72f22ec801c.png)

It should return `The agent has no identities.`. 

If you're getting an error (e.g. `error fetching identities: communication with agent failed`), make sure your vault VM is running and check your VM interconnection setup.

4. Launch KeePassXC and unlock your database.

5. Try fetching your identities on the SSH Client VM. 

   ```shell_prompt
   [user@ssh-client ~]$ ssh-add -L
   ```

6. Allow operation execution.  (If you don't see the below prompt, check your VM interconnection setup.)

   ![operation execution](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/free1/uploads/qubes_os/original/1X/37e62ebb62482d83d878e3481161c72f22ec801c.png)

Check if it returns `ssh-ed25519 <public key string>`

If you're getting an error (e.g. `error fetching identities: communication with agent failed`), make sure your vault VM is running and check your VM interconnection setup.

## Security Benefits

In the setup described in this guide, even an attacker who manages to gain access to the `ssh-client`  VM will not be able to obtain the user’s private key since it is simply not there. 
Rather, the private key remains in the `vault` VM, which is extremely unlikely to be compromised if nothing is ever copied or transferred into it. 
In order to gain access to the vault VM, the attacker would require the use of, e.g., a general Xen VM escape exploit or a signed, compromised package which is already installed in the TemplateVM upon which the vault VM is based.

## Further Security tips
### Regarding Your SSH Private Key
* This goes without saying: keep your private keys **private**. 
* Tinkering with the user permissions is not necessary since it is assumed that an adversary who can find a Xen VM escape exploit is also capable of finding a user to root escalation exploit.

### Regarding Your KeePassXC Database File
Although the database file is encrpyted with your password, if you haven't taken any protective measures, it can be bruteforced. 
Some tips for securing your keys against a `vault` compromise include: 
* Hide the \*.kdbx file by simply renaming the file extension (e.g. \*.zip). Keep in mind this is not likely to stop dedicated adversaries from finding your \*.kdbx file. 
* Adjust the encrpytion settings in KeePassXC as per the [KeePassXC documentation][KeePassXC User Guide].

## Current limitations

* It is possible for a malicious VM to hold onto an ssh-agent connection for more than one use. 
Therefore, if you authorize usage once, assume that a malicious VM could then use it many more times. 
In this case, though, the SSH Agent will continue to protect your private keys; only usage of it would be available to the malicious VM until it was shut down.

* It doesn’t solve the problem of allowing the user to know what is requested before the operation gets approved.
